# Hi, I'm Yonatan ðŸ‘‹
My first experience coding was in elementary school, when I experimented with Scratch during summer camp. Since then, I have explored many other aspects of computer science and technology. From hardware, when I built my own computer at age 12, to web development throughout high school, and now experimenting with Raspberry PI projects with my little brother. I am always looking to explore and innovate, and I firmly believe the best way to learn is by doing!

## Currently working on..
