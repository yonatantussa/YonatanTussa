# Hi, I'm Yonatan ðŸ‘‹
My first experience coding was in elementary school, when I experimented with scratch during summer camp. Since then, I have explored many other aspects of computer science and technology. From Hardware, when I built my own computer at age 12, to Web Development throughout high school, and now experimenting with Raspberry PI projects with my little brother. I am always looking to acquire new skills and experiences, and I firmly believe the best way to learn is by doing!
