# Hi, I'm Yonatan ðŸ‘‹
A lifelong learner with a passion for computer science and technology. My journey began with hardware, when I built my first computer at the age of 12. Since then, I have explored many other aspects of computer science, from web and mobile app development to data analysis and IT. I am always looking to explore and innovate, and I firmly believe the best way to learn is by doing!

## Currently working on..
â€¢ TradeTorch! A platform with one clear objective, connecting lifelong learners with like-minded individuals, established professionals, and a real community to share their thoughts and ideas.
